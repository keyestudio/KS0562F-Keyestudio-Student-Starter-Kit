![Img](/media/img-20230213142757.png)

(2)There are various versions of IDE for Arduino. PLease just download a version compatible with your system. 

If you are Windows, please install Arduino IDE of v2.0.3. Click “**Windows** Win10 and newer, 64bits” or “**Windows** MSI installer” to download and install(.exe). 

Here you need to manually download and install the windows version of Arduino IDE. If we click “**Windows** ZIP file”, Arduino IDE v2.0.3 directly download in a zip format, so you can unzip it to operate without installation.

 Click the icon below to install the Arduino IDE directly:

![Img](/media/img-20230213143914.png)

In general, just click “**JUST DOWNLOAD**” for download, yet if you want, you can choose a small sponsorship to help the great Arduino open source business.

(3)After the Arduino is downloaded, if you download file(.exe)“**arduino-ide_2.0.3_Windows_64bit.exe**” by clicking “**Windows** Win10 and newer,64bits” or “**Windows** MSI installer”, you need to double click file(.exe) to continue its installation. 

When you are warned by operating system, please click “**Allow access**” for allowance. Click “**I Agree**” and select “Anyone who uses this computer(all users)”, and then click "**Next**".

### 1.2. Download CH340 Driver:
Download link: [https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html](https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html)

![Img](/media/img-20230213152802.png)

Here we also provide you our official website for downloading the driver: 
[https://fs.keyestudio.com/CH340-WIN](https://fs.keyestudio.com/CH340-WIN)

### 1.3. Install a Driver:
<span style="color: rgb(255, 76, 0);">(Note: If your computer has already installed a CH340 driver, you do not need to install it again. If not, please follow the steps below.)</span>

Now that the Arduino IDE is installed, we need a driver. Connect 328 PLUS control board to your computer via USB cable.

If your computer is Windows10 system, it will install automatically. If it is other systems like Windows7 or Windows8, you need to install it manually.

USB-Serial port chip of 328 PLUS control board adopts chip CH340C, so we need a driver for this chip: usb_ch341_3.1.2009.06. If connecting 328 PLUS control board to computer for the first time, please click “**My Computer**”--“**Properties**”--“**Device Manager**”, as follows:

![Img](/media/img-20230213153039.png)

Windows10 will automatically install USB-SERIAL CH340 Driver after a while. However, if it fails to install, please operate manually: right-click “**USB2.0-Serial**” to select “**Update Driver**”.

![Img](/media/img-20230213153048.png)

The following page will come out, please select “**Browse my computer for driver software**”.

![Img](/media/img-20230213153127.png)

Click “**Browse...**” and select “**usb_ch341_3.1.2009.06 folder**”。<span style="color: rgb(255, 76, 65);">(Here we move file “usb_ch341_3.1.2009.06 ” on desktop. We have provided it in corresponding folder, so you can use it directly.)</span>

![Img](/media/img-20230213153305.png)

![Img](/media/img-20230213153402.png)

After finishing the installation, click “**Close**”.

![Img](/media/img-20230213153413.png)

![Img](/media/img-20230213153419.png)

Right-click “My Computer”->“Properties”->“Device Manager”->“Ports”, you will see: 

![Img](/media/img-20230213153542.png)

If your computer is not Windows10, please manually select driver files to install it. <span style="color: rgb(255, 76, 65);">(Here you need use the driver “usb_ch341_3.1.2009.06” that we provided)</span>

![Img](/media/img-20230213153305.png)

Installation procedures of CH340 Driver is the same as above. 

### 1.4. Arduino IDE Setting and Toolbar Introduction:

After installing 328 PLUS control board driver, we will now introduce how to use Arduino IDE. 
First of all, connect the control board to computer via USB cable, and click ![Img](/media/img-20230213153810.png) on the desktop to enable Arduino IDE.

![Img](/media/img-20230213154208.png)

In order for avoiding any error when uploading process on mainboard, please do select the correct Arduino board name, which is compatible with the circuit board connecting with computer. Shift “Tools”→“Board”, and choose a board, as shown below:

<span style="color: rgb(255, 76, 65);">(Special Attention: </span> This kit adopts 328 PLUS main control board, please select "Arduino Uno" when choosing board name)

![Img](/media/img-20230213154741.png)

![Img](/media/img-20230213155049.png)

Select a correct COM port (you can see the corresponding COM port if the driver is installed successfully).
<span style="color: rgb(255, 76, 65);">Note: To avoiding errors, COM port should be compatible with the one displayed on Device Manager.</span>
