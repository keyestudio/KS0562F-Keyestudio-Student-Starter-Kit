## 1. Description: 
When we do DIY experiments of electronic product, we often set programs on arduino microcontroller under the development environment of Arduino IDE. 

Keyestudio 328 PLUS control board is fully compatible with Arduino IDE development environment, which includes all functions of official UNO R3 board. 

Besides, we have made some improvements on the basis of UNO R3 board, bringing a more powerful vertion. 

Here are the detailed improvements:
